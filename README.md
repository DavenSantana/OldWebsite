## What is this?

This is a website created for my Computer Science 355 Course, CS 355, or Internet and Web Technologies class.
It links all of the projects I worked on throughout the semester, whether it be from LinkedIn Learning or directly from our professor.
The website is a accumulation of everything I learned throughout the semester including my final project.
The main topics of this class was HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including Node.js and many different libraries. There was a smaller importance on internet protocols and so on but it was still learned.
